<h4><a name="OSCstrings"></a>OSC-string examples</h4>
<p>The string "OSC" is represented as an OSC-string with these four 
  bytes:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>S</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>\0</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The string "data" is represented as an OSC-string with these eight 
  bytes:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td>d</td>
    <td>a</td>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>a</td>
    <td>\0</td>

<h4><a name="OSCaddress"></a>OSC Address Examples</h4>
<p>Suppose a particular OSC Address Space includes an OSC Method with the name 
  "frequency". This method is contained in an OSC Container with the 
  name "3", which is contained in another OSC container named "resonators", 
  which is contained in the OSC container that is the root of the address space 
  tree. The method's OSC Address is "/resonators/3/frequency".</p>
<p>The OSC Address "/a/b/c/d/e" means that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The root of the tree contains an OSC Container with the name "a",</li>
  <li>that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "b",</li>
  <li>that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "c",</li>
  <li>that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "d", 
    and </li>
  <li>that OSC Container contains an OSC Method with the name "e".</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="addressparts"></a>OSC Address Parts Examples</h4>
<p> There are three parts of the OSC Address "/a/b/cde": "a", 
  "b", and "cde". Note that the last part is the name of the 
  OSC Method and the other parts are the names of the OSC Containers that (recursively) 
  contain the method.</p>
<p>There are three parts of the OSC Address pattern "/?/b/*c": "?", 
  "b", and "*c".</p>
<h4><a name="argument"></a>OSC Message Examples</h4>
<p>In each of these examples, each byte of a message is printed first in hexadecimal, 
  followed by the corresponding ASCII character in parentheses.</p>
<p>The OSC Message with the OSC Address Pattern "/oscillator/4/frequency" 
  and the floating point number 440.0 as the single argument would be represented 
  by the following 32-byte message:</p>
<pre> 2f (/)  6f (o)  73 (s)  63 (c)<br> 69 (i)  6c (l)  6c (l)  61 (a)<br> 74 (t)  6f (o)  72 (r)  2f (/)<br> 34 (4)  2f (/)  66 (f)  72 (r)<br> 65 (e)  71 (q)  75 (u)  65 (e)<br> 6e (n)  63 (c)  79 (y)  0 ()<br> 2c (,)  66 (f)  0 ()    0 ()<br> 43 (C)  dc (Ü)  0 ()    0 ()</pre>
<p>The next example shows the 40 bytes in the representation of the OSC Message 
  with OSC Address Pattern "/foo" and 5 arguments:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The int32 1000</li>
  <li>The int32 -1</li>
  <li>The string "hello"</li>
  <li>The float32 1.234</li>
  <li>The float32 5.678</li>
</ol>
<pre> 2f (/)  66 (f)  6f (o)  6f (o)<br> 0 ()    0 ()    0 ()    0 ()<br> 2c (,)  69 (i)  69 (i)  73 (s)<br> 66 (f)  66 (f)  0 ()    0 ()<br> 0 ()    0 ()    3 ()    e8 (è)<br> ff (ÿ)  ff (ÿ)  ff (ÿ)  ff (ÿ)<br> 68 (h)  65 (e)  6c (l)  6c (l)<br> 6f (o)  0 ()    0 ()    0 ()<br> 3f (?)  9d ()   f3 (ó)  b6 (¶)<br> 40 (@)  b5 (µ)  b2 (&#8221;)  2d (-)</pre>
<h4><a name="bundledispatchorder"></a>Order of Invocation of OSC Methods matched 
  by OSC Messages in an OSC Bundle</h4>
<p>Suppose an OSC Servers' OSC Address Space includes methods with the following 
  OSC Addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>/first/this/one</li>
  <li>/second/1</li>
  <li>/second/2</li>
  <li>/third/a</li>
  <li>/third/b</li>
  <li>/third/c</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose an OSC Bundle is received that contains three OSC Messages, and that 
  the three OSC Messages have these OSC Address Patterns:</p>
<ol>
  <li>/first/this/one</li>
  <li>/second/[1-2]</li>
  <li>/third/*</li>
</ol>
<p>Six methods will be invoked in this order:</p>
<p> (1) First /first/this/one, since that OSC Address Pattern appeared first in 
  the OSC Bundle; then </p>
<p>(2-3) Either /second/1 followed /second/2 or /second/2 followed by /second/1; 
  then</p>
<p>(3-6) /third/a, /third/b, and /third/c, in any order.</p>
<p>There are twelve possible orders in which an OSC server may invoke these six 
  methods:</p>
<ol>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/a, /third/b, /third/c</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/a, /third/c, /third/b</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/b, /third/a, /third/c</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/b, /third/c, /third/a</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/c, /third/a, /third/b</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/c, /third/b, /third/a</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/a, /third/b, /third/c</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/a, /third/c, /third/b</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/b, /third/a, /third/c</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/b, /third/c, /third/a</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/c, /third/a, /third/b</li>
  <li>/first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/c, /third/b, /third/a</li>
</ol>
