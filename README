# About
################################################################################

Movid is an acronym that stands for Modular Open Vision Interaction Daemon.
Movid a cross-platform and Open Source vision tracking system, designed to be as
modular as possible. Our current focus is on detection and tracking of humans and
their interaction with computers as well as any objects they might use to do so.
We utilize computer vision, but other sensing techniques could be added as well.

For further reference, see: http://www.movid.org

# Features
################################################################################

* Cross-Platform
Movid is fully cross-platform. It runs on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and FreeBSD.
You can share and use the same "pipeline presets" for every platform.

* Daemon
As the acronym suggests, Movid runs as a daemon process. That means you can
launch it on a headless computer if you want.

* Threading
With Movid, you have the ability to enable threading for any module you want.
That means you are finally able to use your Core 2 Duo / Quad Core to its full
potential. Obviously, you can still use non-threaded mode.

* Remote API
Movid has a JSON API to control all its settings and adjust your pipeline remotely
and on the fly.

* HTML5 Administration
Movid's web interface makes use of the most recent developments in web
programming with open standards like HTML5. All that is required is a compatible
HTML5 web browser. As of today, Firefox 3.6, Safari and Chromium have successfully
run the web interface.

# Compiling Movid
################################################################################

Movid uses the SCons build system (http://www.scons.org/). Quoting the website:
"""SCons is a software construction tool -- that is, a superior alternative to the
classic "Make" build tool that we all know and love."""

This means you have to install SCons to be able to compile movid.
The platform specific compile notes below include instruction on how to install
SCons. Once you have SCons installed open a command line in the movid directory
(the one with this README in it) and run the following command:

To build movid (and dependencies if needed) run:
scons

To clean movid (remove any intermediate files, output libs and executables):
scons -c  (or 'scons --clean')

To also clean the dependencies built in contrib:
scons -c --clean-contrib



For more info about SCons, other options, or how to install it on any system,
you can check the SCons user guide at:
http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Linux Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following instructions are for Ubuntu/Debian.
They should be easily transferable to other linux distributions.
Building from source on these distributions is really easy.

First, you have to install the opencv headers, git and the build-tools:
sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev git-core build-essential scons

Then, you get the current development version of Movid:
git clone git://github.com/tito/Movid.git

Afterwards, we change to the Movid repo you just cloned:
cd Movid

It is time to compile, let's run scons!
scons

Now you should be able to use movid already. Try the simple-video preset:
./movid -l presets/simple-video.txt

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your webbrowser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Windows Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To build movid, you will have to install a couple of things first.
You will need OpenCV, Visual C++ 2010, and scons (which also requires python)

1. Install OpenCV-2.1
download and run the following file:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.1/OpenCV-2.1.0-win32-vs2008.exe/download

2. install Visual C++ Express 2010 (not needed if you have Visual Studio 2010)
not: must be 2010 version!  you can download a free version here (select language to start download):
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP

3. install Python and scons
download and run the following files:
http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-2.0.1.win32.exe

OK, you're ready to build.  If you installed everything to default locations just run:
scons

If you installed OpenCV to a non standard location:
scons OPENCV_DIR=C:\Somewhere\Else\OpenCV


Note:  movid will build, with references to teh OpenCV dll's.
If they are not on your path, you must copy them to the directory where you are trying to run movid.
By default, tehy are in C:\OpenCV2.1\bin just copy the follwoing files into the movid directory:
cv210.dll cvaux210.dll cxcore210.dll highgui210.dll


Now you should be able to use movid already. just double click movid.exe or run it from teh command line to use a preset:
movid -l presets/simple-video.txt

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your webbrowser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ OSX Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. On OSX, you must build OpenCV  yourself.
We *strongly* suggest you use homebrew for this.
See http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ for more details.
After you have installed homebrew, simply type this at
the command prompt:
	brew install opencv
Depending on your configuration, this maybe has to be
run as root with `sudo` before the command.

2. installl scons
download the follwoing file:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-2.0.1.zip

3. unzip teh file, open a terminal and navigate to that directory:
cd scons-2.0.1
python setup.py instal

You're ready to build, just run:
scons


Note: If you need to build moved as 32bit, you can do so by forcing the -m32 flag on the compilers for both moved and all libs in contrib by running:
CC='gcc -m32' CXX='g++ -m32' scons

Now you should be able to use movid already. Try the simple-video preset:
./movid -l presets/simple-video.txt

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your webbrowser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/
